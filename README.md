# GeoOS Next - Geospatial Operations System

> **inDrive Hackathon Solution**: A Next.js-based platform for analyzing anonymized GPS tracks, creating demand heat maps, and optimizing driver distribution using real-time geospatial data.

## 🎯 Problem & Value

This solution addresses key challenges in ride-sharing operations:

- **Demand Forecasting**: Predict ride demand 10-60 minutes ahead using ML models
- **Driver Optimization**: Intelligently redistribute drivers to high-demand areas
- **Safety Monitoring**: Detect unusual routes and potential safety concerns
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce wait times, increase driver utilization, and optimize service coverage

**Business Impact**: Improved customer satisfaction, increased driver earnings, and enhanced operational efficiency through data-driven decision making.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, pnpm (or npm)
corepack enable

# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Aiyo28/geo-os.git
cd geo-os
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## 📊 Data Input Methods

### CSV Upload
Upload anonymized GPS track files via web interface:
```
randomized_id,lat,lng,spd,seq,timestamp
vehicle_001,51.128207,71.430564,45,1,2024-09-14T10:00:00Z
```

### Webhook API
Real-time data ingestion via POST endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tracks": [{"id": "v001", "lat": 51.128207, "lng": 71.430564, "timestamp": "2024-09-14T10:00:00Z"}]}'
```

## 🔬 Technical Approach

### Geospatial Processing
- **H3 Hexagonal Indexing**: Efficient spatial aggregation at resolution 7 (~5km²)
- **Real-time Clustering**: DBSCAN algorithm for demand hotspot detection
- **Multi-layer Visualization**: Current demand, forecasts, and anomalies

### Machine Learning Models
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: Short-term trend detection
- **Hour-of-Week Patterns**: Cyclical demand modeling
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical outlier identification for safety

### Privacy & Ethics
- **Complete Anonymization**: No personally identifiable information
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential geospatial coordinates processed
- **Bias Mitigation**: Equal treatment across geographic regions

## 🎮 Demo Scenarios
